## About me:

Hello, my name is Abdalla Moustafa, a year 2 student majoring in Computer Science.

## Hobbies:

I dedicate most of my free time for taking pictures. I have been taking photography as a serious hoby for a couple of years now and I recently shifted my focus more into Videography.

I have been working with React framework a lot recently and I'm planning to create a personal website during summer. Apart from that, I have been learning how to use tensorflow library in python and I intend on learning all the necessary skills both in programming and statistics to create a machine learning model on my own.

### Fields I'm interested in:

* Computer Vision
* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Particle Accelerators
* Space exploration
